# braillix_ratatui

This is a small adapter crate to support using `braillix` with
[`ratatui`](https://ratatui.rs).

Check out the `examples/` directory to see usage, or run them with (e.g.):
```sh
$ cargo run --example rotating_triangle
```

`braillix` is still under development, so the API may change.
